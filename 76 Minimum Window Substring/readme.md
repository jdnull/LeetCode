# 76 Minimum Window Substring

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

For example,

**S** = `"ADOBECODEBANC"`

**T** = `"ABC"`

Minimum window is `"BANC"`.

##### Note:

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the emtpy string `""`.

If there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
